# Salary-Prediction-using-K-Nearest-Neighbor
This prediction project is used to predict the salary of the employee based on the previous employee details.
to predict we are using knn algorithm, where K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
It is also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.
